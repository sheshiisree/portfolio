        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Graduate Assistant, Texas Tech University</strong> (Sept 2023 - Present)</p>
        <p> As a Graduate Assistant, I frequently worked with data organization, report generation, and process optimization, which aligned with my later experience in designing and building BPM applications using Appian’s low-code platform. The ability to analyze user requirements, structure workflows, and implement solutions at the university level helped me transition seamlessly into application development. My work in streamlining administrative tasks translated into optimizing process models in Appian to improve business workflows and enhance operational efficiency.
Additionally, while assisting with research and academic projects, I developed a strong understanding of user-friendly interface design—an essential skill when developing applications using Appian SAIL. My ability to work closely with professors, students, and administrative staff also helped me refine my stakeholder collaboration skills, a crucial aspect of gathering business requirements and translating them into functional solutions in application development.
</p>
        <p><strong>Cloud Engineer, Numeric Technologies</strong> (Sept 2022 - July 2023)</p>
<p> <ul>
<li> Worked with the client Autodesk </li>
 <li> Designed and built BPM applications using Appian's low-code platform </li>
<li> Created and optimized process models to streamline workflows.</li>
<li> Developed user-friendly interfaces with Appian SAIL.</li>
<li> Collaborated with stakeholders to understand and document business requirements.</li>
<li> Conducted application testing, troubleshooting, and performance optimization </li>
<li> Provided end-user training and technical support post-deployment</li>
<li> Worked on Record Types</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Data Engineer, Tiger Analytics</strong> (Mar 2022 - Aug 2022)</p>
<p> In this internship, I have created a project where data transfers from one bucket to another bucket using a data pipeline with some transformations. To build this project I have used AWS tools, Python, PySpark, Apache Airflow, ETL pipeline. </p>

    <section id="projects" class="container py-5">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inventory Management</strong> - Developed using Appian BPM & MariaDB.</li>
             <p>An advanced Inventory Management Application designed specifically for the automobile industry, this solution streamlines the tracking and management of vehicle parts and accessories. The application offers real-time inventory updates, automated restocking alerts, and detailed reporting to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.</p>
            <li><strong>Clinical Research</strong> - Streamlined clinical submissions.</li>
<p> This application allows the planners to create a new clinical submission request which then goes through different levels of validation and approval steps on the completion of which the Drug becomes clinically approved to be marketed in the selected countries. It also incorporates a separate issue workflow to raise, assign and track issues pertaining to a specific submission request. It allows the managers to view the history of all the submission requests, current publisher workload and the list of all the submissions due in the future in the form of reports. This application supports both auto and manual assignment of submission requests to specific work groups based on certain business logics.</p>
            <li><strong>Drowsiness Detection</strong> - Built using OpenCV & Keras.</li>
<p>I have worked on a Significant major project Drowsiness Detection System using OpenCV and Keras which uses Python, OpenCV, and Keras to warn drivers when they start to nod off and prevent accidents</p>
            <li><strong>Sign Language Recognition</strong> - Developed with CNN for accessibility.</li>
<p>I have worked on a minor project called “SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION”, which uses the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) method and is used for deaf and dumb people.</p>
